Stacks
•	Abstract Data Type (ADT)
•	Implements LIFO – “Last-In First-Out”
•	Operations:
	o	Push: Add item to the top
	o	Pop: remove top item
	o	Peek: Get top item without removing it. 
•	Can be backed up by an array or a linked list
Peek works for O(1) all cases
If backed up by a LinkedList: push pop work for O(1)
If backed by an array
	-	If enough space Push - O(1) else O(n) because of array resizing
	-	Pop  is O(1) if we never shrink the array else its O(n)
If there is enough mem on device or max num is unknown LinkedList is preferable as a structure
If not enough mem or max num know array is preferable


Built in Stacks in C#
Import Stack<T> works the same way as we built it
Built in stack is based on an Array
Trim excess only works if there is 90% used
