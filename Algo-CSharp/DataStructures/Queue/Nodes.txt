Queue
-	FIFO (First-in, First-out)
-	Enqueue – Add an Item to the end of the Queue
-	Dequeue – Remove an item at the front of the Queue
-	Peek – Get an Item at the front of the Queue without removing it

Big O
-	Peek Works for O(1) in any cases
-	If backed up by a LinkedList: Enqueue and Dequeue will be O(1)
-	If backed up by an array, Then Enqueue and Dequeue:
	o	If enough space Enqueue O(1) else O(n) 
	o	Dequeue O(1) if we never shrink else O(N)
-	If there is enough mem on device or we don’t know the max number of Items then use a LinkedList else use Array

Circular Queue

Wrapped the tail gies behind the head, once the last element is full you unwrap the array to double it in size

Built in Queues

- Queue Built in as a circular based on Array
